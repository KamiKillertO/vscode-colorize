#### New decoration type

It's now possible to render colors as a line below the color.
To change the way colors are displayed, change the value of the setting `colorize.decoration_type`.
This setting accepts the two values `background` and `underline`:

- `background`, colors are rendered as a background for the text.

## 0.9.2

### Fix

Check an issue preventing the extension form working with the Tabnine extension.

## 0.9.1

### Fix

Add default values for setting `colorize.include` to ensure CSS, SASS and LESS variables are extracted by default on windows10. For some reason, For some reason, vscode does not behave the same on windows 10 as on Linux/macOS. As a result, the extension cannot auto-extract variables from css/scss/sass files using only the list of languages listed on the `colorize.languages` setting.

## 0.9.0

### Breaking

#### Remove deprecated setting `colorize.files_extension`

Now the extension will only use the values of the settings `colorize.languages`, `colorize.include` and `colorize.exclude` to decide whether or colors should be decorated in a file.

#### Make `colorize.colorize_only_visible_beta` the default behavior

The purpose of this option was to only generate a colored background for colors that are on the visible part of the editor. This has a huge perf impact especially for big files with a lot of colors.

The setting `colorize.colorize_only_visible_beta` was introduced a long time ago without any issues. So it's now the default behavior.

### Fix

Correct a typo preventing the browser color `burlywood` from being colorized.
